AWS IP Rotator
==============

Changes an EC2 VPC machine's IP address every ten minutes using Elastic IP.

Requires valid AWS credentials in `~/.aws/config` -- which can be generated by running `aws configure`.


Usage
-----

Change your IP (one off):


```bash
./aws-ip-rotator.sh
```

Start rotating IPs every ten minutes:

```bash
./aws-ip-rotator.sh start
```

Stop it:

```bash
./aws-ip-rotator.sh stop
```

To change a specific interface, add the interface's MAC address to the MAC variable in the script.
